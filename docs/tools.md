# Tools

In the [Prerequisites section](pre.md) I gave you a list of tools needed in order to follow along but what are they for.

- `kubectl`: This is a tool that provides you an API to interact with a kubernetes cluster.

- `minikube`: This is a tool that helps you build a kubernetes cluster on you host machine.
- `helm`: This is a tool used for installing helm charts, which are essentially pre-configured kubernetes deployments. You can think of it as a Kubernetes Package Manager, similar to apt, brew, pip etc.
